# Flower image recognition 

The dataset contains a total of 4242 labeled images of daisies, dandelions, roses, sunflowers and tulips. 

The aim of this project is to create a model which identifies the type of flower based on the given image. 
I used image processing tools as well as convolutional neural networks to build the model. 
The dataset is taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition">Kaggle</a>.
